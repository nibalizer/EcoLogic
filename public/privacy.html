            <h2 class="eco-logic-bold">Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                As a global organization offering a wide range of
                products and services, with business processes,
                management structures and technical systems that cross
                borders, Eco Logic has implemented global policies, along with
                standards and procedures, for consistent protection of
                personal information. As a global company, we may share
                information about you with our subsidiaries world-wide
                and transfer it to countries in the world where we do
                business in accordance with this Privacy Statement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Between Eco Logic controlled subsidiaries we only grant access
                to personal information on a need-to-know basis,
                necessary for the purposes for which such access is
                granted. In some cases, Eco Logic uses suppliers located in
                various countries to collect, use, analyze, and
                otherwise process personal information on its behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where appropriate, Eco Logic may also share your personal
                information with selected partners to help us provide
                you, or the company you work for, products or services,
                or to fulfill your requests, or with your consent. When
                selecting our suppliers and partners, we take into
                account their data handling processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                If Eco Logic decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise
                reorganize businesses in some countries, such a
                transaction may involve the disclosure of personal
                information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the
                receipt of such information from sellers. It is
                Eco Logic's practice to require appropriate protection for
                personal information in these types of transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal
                information may be subject to disclosure to government
                agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order,
                or legal process. We may also share your personal
                information to protect the rights or property of Eco Logic,
                our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others
                when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such
                rights or property have been or could be affected.

            <h2 class="eco-logic-bold">International Transfers</h2>
            <p>
                The international footprint of Eco Logic involves a large
                number of transfers of personal information between
                different subsidiaries, as well as to third parties
                located in the countries where we do business. Some
                countries have implemented transfer restrictions for
                personal information, in connection with which Eco Logic takes
                various measures, including:
